## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in SQL

Wrote SQL queries to understand the dataset and establish foundational metrics:

- Total sales and quantity sold
- Customer distribution by gender and region
- First and last order dates per customer
- Business metrics: total revenue, product categories, and customer counts

### 2. 🧠 Advanced SQL Analytics

Crafted in-depth SQL queries to uncover deeper business insights:

- Yearly and Monthly sales trends
- Customer segmentation based on spend (New, Regular, VIP)
- Product sales performance by category and subcategory
- Price vs quantity sold patterns
- Top customer and product reports for dashboard use

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Quarterly Sales Spike:** Sales increase consistently in Q4—likely due to holiday shopping.
- **Customer Segmentation:** New customers form the largest group, but VIPs contribute high revenue per order.
- **80/20 Sales Rule:** Top 10 products contribute disproportionately to revenue.
- **Demographic Focus:** Age group 40–59 leads in spending—ideal for campaign targeting.
- **Category-Sales Mismatch:** Accessories attract more customers but contribute less to revenue, while Bikes have fewer buyers but generate high revenue.
- **Product Dependence:** 94% of total revenue comes from high-performing products.
- **Subcategory Strength:** Mountain and Road Bikes dominate sales consistently.
